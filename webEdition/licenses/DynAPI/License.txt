INSTRUCTIONS

Any of these JavaScript library files can be inserted into a web page
by using the following tag:

<script language="JavaScript" src="<filename>"></script>

It is preferred if you keep all the JavaScript files independent of
eachother, however I understand that this is sometimes not the most
desirable means for using JavaScript.  It is fine if you wish to
amalgamate some of the functions as long as as the copyright remains
in tact wherever the JavaScript that is used appears.

Documentation for this API is currently provided by my Dynamic HTML
Tutorial.  More detailed documentation will be added to the DynAPI
as time permits.
