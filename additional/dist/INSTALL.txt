INSTALLATION

1. unzip the archive webEdition_{VERSION}.zip and upload its 
   contents to your web server directly into the DOCUMENT_ROOT
2. check all file permissions. The webserver has to have write 
   access to the DOCUMENT ROOT and the webEdition directory.
   You can do that with a ftp application, i.e. filezilla.
   IMPORTANT: do not use a 0777 file mask on a shared hosting 
   environment!!!
3. start your favourite web browser (please check our browser 
   compatibility list on the website) and open the following url:
   http://YOURDOMAIN/setup.php
4. Follow the instructions of this small configuration script
5. Enter your database access parameters

If all went well you should be able to start webEdition with this url:

  http://YOURDOMAIN/webEdition/index.php

IMPORTANT: 
Once you have successfully configured your new webEdition installation, 
delete this setup script in order to prevent damage by misuse.
