Important informations for webEdition translators:
------------------------------------------------------------

The directory 
   webEdition/lang/
contains tmx files (xml) with all language files used in 
the webEdition SDK. The language directory names are 
2-character ISO 3166-2 language codes, for example:
   webEdition/lang/de/
   webEdition/lang/fi/

The other language files of webEdition are located in
   webEdition/we/include/we_language/
and have the language names as they have been used in all 
the previous webEdition versions, for example:
   webEdition/we/include/we_language/English_UTF-8
   webEdition/we/include/we_language/Dutch_UTF-8

IMPORTANT:

Please note that starting with webEdition 6 ALL LANGUAGE 
FILES ARE UTF-8 ENCODED! This goes for the language files 
in we_languages as well as for the new tmx files. 

The german, english, finnish and dutch ISO-8859-1 language 
files are created by our deployment utility that is used 
for creating new webEdition versions.

If you want to use the latest versions of these language 
files, you can get them from the Sourceforge Subversion 
server. There is a translation branch for each language, 
for example:
   branches/translation_finnish
   branches/translation_dutch
Just replace the respective directories in your webEdition 
installation with the directories from SVN.
Please bear in mind that these files may be incomplete, 
so PHP Notices may occur if there are new text elements 
that have not been translated yet (only for the old-style 
language files in webEdition/we/include/we_language/).
